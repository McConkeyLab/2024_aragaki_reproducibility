This is the 'standalone' version of my thesis chapter about 'bespoke software' and reproducibility within the lab setting.

This book should be able to be built with Typst 0.12.0. Other typst packages should be installed automatically. Much to my chagrin (and to somewhat ironically) these code examples are 'baked in', so this is _not_ literate programming. Typst just doesn't do that, and the org-mode implementation of it just doesn't quite hit the mark. Alas!!!

Listen, I've even included a PDF for you. I know, I know. I should probably make you build it yourself. And if you want to, you can. But I'm not here to make you eat your vegetables. Enjoy.
